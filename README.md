# Do-file for reading PISA 2012 in Stata
Stata do-files to read raw PISA2012 txt files

Older PISA microdata (OECDâ€™s Programme for International Student Assessment) is provided only in .txt format with SAS and SPSS reading files, but lacks Stata equivalents. This repository contains Stata do-files to read PISA 2012 raw files and an R script for automating do-file creation. It could potentially be adapted for other PISA datasets, though I haven't tested that. It can also be used for writing reading scripts in other programming languages, with some time investiment.

The folder "output" contains the Stata do-files. The folder "input" contains the SAS reading files that I used as base. Those files can be downloaded (here)[https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/pisa-2012-database.html], where you can also download the .txt raw microdata. The R script "Script_creating_dofile_GitHb.R" creates the do-files in a automized way. "PISA_txt_to_dta.Rproj" and "pathconfig.R" are used for working directory configuration.

Hope this helps someone, any questions feel free to ask me.
